<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Aiswarya—a curious and creative mind exploring the exciting world of web development. I’ve recently started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m loving the mix of logic and imagination it takes to bring a webpage to life. Every line of code feels like solving a mini-puzzle, and I’m constantly amazed by how ideas turn into interactive digital experiences.</p>
