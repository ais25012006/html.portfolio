<hr />
<h3>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</h3>
<p>It isn’t just a film—it’s a philosophy wrapped in poetry, adventure, and friendship. Directed by Zoya Akhtar, this gem follows three childhood friends—Arjun, Kabir, and Imran—on a soul-searching road trip across Spain. What begins as a bachelor getaway turns into a journey of self-discovery, healing, and letting go of fears.</p>

<h3>The Pursuit Of Happyness</h3>
<p>It is a heartfelt story of a father’s struggle to build a better life for his son. Will Smith’s powerful performance captures the pain, hope, and determination it takes to keep going when everything falls apart.</p>
<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>It is a fun yet powerful film about three engineering students who challenge the pressure-filled education system. With humor and heart, it encourages us to follow passion over convention and reminds us that learning is more than just grades.</p>
